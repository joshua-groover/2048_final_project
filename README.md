# 2048_final_project

This repository contains my final project 2048 project for an introduction to software development class.

2048 is a popular app where the goal is to get as many points as possible by swipping in various diretions to combine number blocks. The goal of this assignment was to build an "AI" to play 2048 and get a higher score than just swipping in random directions. 

The AIMain2048.java file runs all of my code and compares the scores of the random swipper to the "AI" I built. I am still working on adding documentation and cleaning some of the code.
